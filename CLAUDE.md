# Project Instructions for Claude

This is a Dockerized Python backend project using Flask and Neo4j.

## How to work with this repo
- Prefer searching before opening files.
- Do not attempt to read very large files in full; open only relevant sections.
- When asked to locate functionality, list file paths and summarize usage.
- When suggesting changes, show diffs or focused snippets, not entire files.

## Focus areas
- Backend Python code and Neo4j usage (official Neo4j Python driver).
- docker-compose setup and environment-based configuration.

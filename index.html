  <h2>Had Fun Building Anything Lately?</h2><p>Let me tell you why I built <strong>InsightViewer</strong>.</p><p>I’ve always loved knowledge graphs, Neo4j, and tools like Browser and Bloom. They make exploring connected data both powerful and intuitive. But there’s a catch — Bloom only works with the Enterprise edition, which is out of reach for many of us. And while Browser is great for developers, it’s not designed for end users.</p><p>So, I decided to build something that fills the gap.</p><h2>🧠 Introducing InsightViewer</h2><p><strong>InsightViewer</strong> is a lightweight, flexible visualization tool that complements Neo4j Browser and Bloom. It’s designed to make knowledge graphs more accessible, interactive, and fun to explore — without requiring an Enterprise license.</p><p>During development, I realized that knowledge graphs are everywhere. They’re not just about data — they’re about connecting ideas. Here are a few ways you can use InsightViewer:</p><ul><li>🏢 Represent business applications as knowledge graphs</li><li>💻 Map out the entire software development lifecycle</li><li>📚 Visualize and organize everything you learn</li></ul><h3>🌐 Beyond Nodes and Edges</h3><p>Every visualization has its limits. Sometimes you need to add a bit more context — text, visuals, or links. That’s why InsightViewer lets you attach HTML content directly to nodes. This turns each node into a dynamic container for deeper insights, unlocking endless possibilities for combining structure and storytelling.</p><h2>✨ Key Features</h2><ul><li>🔍 Neo4j Integration – Connects directly to your Neo4j database for live data exploration</li><li>🕸️ Interactive Graphs – Powered by vis-network, offering smooth zoom, drag, and highlight interactions</li><li>🧩 HTML-Enhanced Nodes – Attach descriptions, images, or links to graph nodes</li><li>⚙️ Customizable Views – Adjust layout, colors, and display options to fit your workflow</li><li>🌍 Browser-Based UI – Built for accessibility; no Enterprise edition required</li></ul><h2>🧱 Tech Stack</h2><ul><li><strong>Backend:</strong> Flask (Python)</li><li><strong>Database:</strong> Neo4j</li><li><strong>Frontend:</strong> vis-network + HTML5</li><li><strong>Environment:</strong> Docker + Ubuntu</li><li><strong>Language:</strong> Python 3</li></ul><h2>💡 Why I Built It</h2><p>InsightViewer started as a side project — a way to combine my curiosity for knowledge graphs with my need for a more approachable visualization tool. Over time, it evolved into a platform where I can see ideas connect, whether they’re about business logic, learning materials, or code architecture.</p><h2>🎬 Enough Talk. Let’s View the Insight and have fun.</h2><p>Clone it, run it, and start exploring your data the visual way.</p>
